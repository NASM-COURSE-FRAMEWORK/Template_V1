      <item id="0">In the 1950s, health clubs consisted of bodybuilders, power lifters, Olympic lifters, and athletes. It was a male-dominated environment in which men trained with free weights to increase mus-cle size and strength. Then, in 1951 Jack LaLanne began hosting America’s first televised fitness show, The Jack LaLanne Show, which aired until 1984. Jack’s workouts consisted mainly of cal-isthenics intermixed with tips on counting calories, weight training, and nutrition. Yet before pioneering a TV show, at the age of 21 Jack LaLanne opened his first health club in Oakland, California, in 1936 where he invented the cable pulley weight training system and the Smith weightlifting machine. Today, both of these implements are still actively used in most fitness centers around the world.
